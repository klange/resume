# klange's résumé

This is the source for my résumé/CV, as well as [the site that hosts it](http://r.dakko.us/).

The main content of my CV is written in LaTeX. It is combined with source data from a crafted bootable ISO of my operating system, [ToaruOS](https://github.com/klange/toaruos), to form a hybrid ISO/PDF file. This repository contains the LaTeX source, the Python scripts that produce the ISO payload and reinstall the bootloader to the resulting PDF, as well as scripts that prepare and deploy the webpage.

A complete overview of how the hybrid ISO/PDF portion of the résumé works is available [here](https://gist.github.com/klange/c49d7836a53c922384ae90fe0ed0e16e).
